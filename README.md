# A-simple-Game
exploring my coding knowledge in  this simple game.

#What i have tried to do?
Improving my coding knowledge by implementing pseudo-random generation and actually displaying the game. 

#What is the purpose of the game?
In this early stage, the purpose of the game is to maximize your score by selecting different items.
The more you play, the more you will learn the best combos to use to get a higher score.

#Future plans
I plan to implement a tutorial, to better describe the game
A highscore system to remeber the highest score on the device
Creating potions that give you extra moves or extra points
A better GUI and new art
